# Asicseer-WebUI
A simple asicseer webui interface.

There are 3 variables you need to change based on your setup,
1 is the coindeskAPIKEY, this fetches realtime api data from coindesk. Make an account to get the key.
2 is the bitaxe IP, this fetches network data from the bitaxe api because asicseer doesent have that inside the logs for some reason.
3 is the logs directory, every setup is different so make sure to set this to your asicseer logs path.


Please run the following to install dependencies:
`pip install flask`

To run:
`python main.py`

Im not a professional flask developer so take this with a grain of salt. Im not developing this any further so if you need to make changes please make them yourself.
